ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted rivals in a few years novartis could face gilenya generics thanks to some recent patent decisions as early as in fact and that would give these three meds just a few more years to divvy up share just among themselves add to that the payer pressure that increasingly a problem and the growth option looks even less likely related articles biogen s tecfidera amgen s enbrel tell a tale of pricing power

ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted rivals in a few years novartis could face gilenya generics thanks to some recent patent decisions as early as in fact and that would give these three meds just a few more years to divvy up share just

ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted rivals in a few years novartis could face gilenya generics thanks to some recent patent decisions as early as in fact and that would give these three meds just a few more years to divvy up share just among themselves add to that the payer pressure that increasingly a problem and the growth option looks even less likely related articles biogen s tecfidera amgen s enbrel tell a tale of pricing power

insisted today pointing to two markets that for years have been in reimbursements while the was a haven of growth the answer came in response to a question posed to execs today during a call with

ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted

two markets that for years have been in reimbursements while the was a haven of growth the answer came in response to a question posed to execs today during a call with analysts as they reported that novo novo operating profit fell in and for the year is now expected to be half of what the company had projected months ago instead of that news whacked share prices in early trading an analyst wanted

ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted rivals in a few years novartis could face gilenya generics thanks to some recent patent decisions as early as in fact and that would give these three meds just a few more years to divvy up share just

environment ceo lars insists it will do that by calling on its experiences jousting with price regulators in europe we have been used to operating in such an environment in the eu and in japan insisted today pointing to two markets that for years have been in reimbursements while the was a haven of growth the answer came in response to a question posed to execs today during a call with analysts as they reported that novo novo operating profit fell in and for the year is now expected to be half of what the company had projected months ago instead of that news whacked share prices in early trading an analyst wanted to know if the danish company required a different structure and different people to make money in a tough market said that it did insisting its commitment to the market was steadfast but will not have to fight the battles there any longer he is stepping down at and is being replaced by lars fruergaard jorgensen who currently the company evp and head of

competitors novo and sanofi are both developing new weekly combo meds in that category although both have had consideration of their drugs delayed by the fda he says it is reasonable to assume such growth but points out that novo was not considering the worst case while novo execs said they did not expect payers to go to a single source market for drugs to extract deeper discounts gal does not

ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted rivals in a few years novartis could face gilenya generics thanks to some recent patent decisions as early as in fact and that would give these three meds just a few more years to divvy up share just

ceo says by eric palmer oct novo nordisk is facing a future of price decreases and pressured profits in the but the organization is equipped to thrive in such a hostile pricing environment ceo lars insists it will do that by calling on its experiences jousting with price regulators in europe we have been used to operating in such an environment in the eu and in japan insisted today pointing to two markets that for years have been in reimbursements while the was a haven of growth the answer came in response to a question posed to execs today during a call with analysts as they reported that novo novo operating profit fell in and for the year is now expected to be half of what the company had projected months ago instead of that news whacked share prices in early trading an analyst wanted to know if the danish company required a different structure and different people to make money in a tough market said that it did insisting its commitment to the market was steadfast but will not have to fight the battles there any longer he is stepping down at and is being replaced by lars fruergaard jorgensen who currently the company evp and head of corporate development jorgensen acknowledged that the market will be extremely tough in the near term but growth in china and other parts of the world will help compensate until the market starts to turn around in he said when we look across the world the change in the operating environment is mainly in we have to acknowledge we are not fully satisfied with the operations jorgensen said but the company has the right portfolio for a turnaround there and with a restructuring in the operations we will get a grip jorgensen insisted that restructuring was announced in september with people worldwide being let go due to cut

both developing new weekly combo meds in that category although both have had consideration of their drugs delayed by the fda he says it is reasonable to assume such growth but points out that novo was not considering the worst case while novo execs said they did not expect payers to go to a single source market for drugs to extract deeper discounts gal does not rule it out if there is another cut to expectations this is likely where it comes from he told investors suggesting that a really rocky midterm market for novo could still get rockier here s the earnings release related articles

ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted rivals in a few years novartis could face gilenya generics thanks to some recent patent decisions as early as in fact and that would give these three meds just a few more years to divvy up share just

insisted today pointing to two markets that for years have been in reimbursements while the was a haven of growth the answer came in response to a question posed to execs today during a call with analysts as they reported that novo novo operating profit fell in and for the year is now expected to be half of what the company had projected months ago instead of that news whacked share prices in early trading an analyst wanted to know if the danish company required a different structure and different people to make money in a tough market said that it did insisting its commitment to the market was steadfast but will not have to fight the battles there any longer he is stepping down at and is being replaced by lars fruergaard jorgensen who currently the company evp and head of

ms share is about to heat up by tracy staton oct multiple sclerosis drugmakers are in a fix these days the market isn t delivering the kind of growth that had been fueling big increases in sales for pills from biogen tecfidera and novartis gilenya that could mean an unwelcome comedown it definitely means the coming battle will grow even more competitive than before if the quickest way to grow sales is to steal share you can bet tecfidera and gilenya and their rival med from sanofi aubagio will be working hard to do just that thing is biogen isn t on that sort of growth trajectory it s the market leader with share of the oral market and of ms overall as evp michel vounatsos hastened to point out during the company s earnings call with analysts last week but tecfidera s growth during the quarter largely depended on price increases the company disclosed in a securities filing the next day gilenya on the other hand grew by and in its earnings announcement the swiss drugmaker said that growth wasn t based on price but volume that s not to say gilenya doesn t have some troubling signs in its stats pharma chief paul hudson said script numbers have been broadly flat but a little bit down which suggests the overall market slowdown hasn t been without its effect on gilenya too neither biogen nor novartis plans to stick with the status quo biogen is grappling with tecfidera s gastrointestinal side effects and various ms specialists are working on ways to manage that of tecfidera patients quit because of gi issues and keeping patients on therapy would obviously help sales the tecfidera team is a new engagement model at top treatment centers with plans to roll it out by january the team in the is all up and running vounatsos said during the call i m very pleased to see the perception improvement and now we have to continue to on the advertising side biogen recently backed off a tv campaign that had stirred up some controversy in the ms community and the company said at the time that it didn t plan more television in the immediate future though it is running other dtc promos novartis is running with its hey ms take this campaign for gilenya which launched in and has since won kudos and made inroads particularly with its digital and social media work besides print and web video the campaign invites patients to tell relapsing ms exactly where to go and many have both on the campaign s website and via social media they ve also shared what they do to manage their novartis apparently believes that gilenya dtc and salesforce work coupled with a steady stream of new data will keep the brand s volume growing enough to avoid using price as a driver the company has some sensible plans for growth without a big impact on price hudson said during the call we are looking forward to the energy into he said meanwhile the big leaper of the quarter was aubagio sanofi s entry in the class sales of that drug grew by almost to million euros during the quarter and that was driven by growth in the its revenue amounted to million euros a hike the french drugmaker quickly bragged that aubagio is the oral disease modifying therapy in ms with a share of far far below tecfidera s but rising this time last year sanofi was happy to report it had captured a share what s spurring aubagio on the company has been running a campaign with revenge star madeleine stowe since late for one the actor has been traveling across the doing awareness events the lights camera take action partnership most recently rolled out a series of webisodes featuring stowe in interviews with ms patients a common theme in awareness campaigns but also with nurses physical therapists and others with advice for ms patients and their caregivers the drug brand website also has a channel and sanofi has put other promo work under a tagline aubagio quiets the company has set out a goal of billion in sales by for its entire franchise if aubagio and its fellow med lemtrada keep delivering as they are the company could actually hit that target sooner in ms we continued to gain share and sales from the franchise are now approaching billion on an annualized basis ceo olivier brandicourt said during the company call biogen s vounatsos may have summed it up for the entire oral market when he pledged to fight the good fight on tecfidera last week the base of the market is certainly lower than what we have estimated in our assumptions but it not an excuse for not increasing share he said there s a confounding factor however the group of oral treatments may get some unwanted rivals in a few years novartis could face gilenya generics thanks to some recent patent decisions as early as in fact and that would give these three meds just a few more years to divvy up share just
